# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

# Notice that you may not slant the container.

# Example 1:
# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [1,1]
# Output: 1

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        res=0
        l,r=0,len(height)-1

        while l<r:
            area=(r-l)*min(height[l],height[r])
            res=max(res,area)

            if height[r]>height[l]:
                l+=1
            else:
                r-=1
        return res
